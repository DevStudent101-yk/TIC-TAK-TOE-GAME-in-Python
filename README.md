# TIC-TAK-TOE-GAME-in-Python
#Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Pygame library. Players can play against each other or against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.

#Features
Play against another player or an AI.
Visually appealing game interface with a grid and colored symbols (X and O).
Reset the game by pressing the 'R' key.
Requirements
To run this game, you need to have Python installed along with the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip:

Download or clone this repository.
Navigate to the directory where the game file is located.
Run the game using the following command:
bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py

#Game Controls
Mouse Click: Click on a square in the grid to place your symbol (X for Player 1 and O for Player 2 or AI).
R Key: Press the 'R' key to restart the game at any time.

#Gameplay
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in an empty square.
The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If all squares are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
AI Opponent
The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging game experience.

#Future Enhancements
Add an option to choose the difficulty level for the AI.
Implement a scoring system to track wins and losses.
Allow players to choose their symbols (X or O).
